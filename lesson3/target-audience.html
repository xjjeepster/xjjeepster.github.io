        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>The target audience will mainly be outdoor enthusiasts who enjoy a variety of activities that can be affected by the weather. This will include summer and winter activities. As this site will feature specific cities in Idaho, it will focus on
            weather-related activities for those areas. Whether youâ€™re a mountain biker hoping for a warm summer day, or an ice-fisherman hoping for freezing conditions we will have the latest weather forecasts and information available. </p>

        <p>AGE: 38</p>
        <p>PURPOSE OF VISIT: Joe is a father of 4 and enjoys taking his children ice fishing. As his children are still young, he needs to watch weather forcasts carefully to make sure the ice will be thick enough and also so the weather isn't too stormy
            for his young children.
        </p>
        <p>DEVICES USED: Joe will check the site both with his iPhone 7 when out in the field to monitor conditions, and also will use his home PC when planning trips.

        <p>AGE: 39</p>
        <p>PURPOSE OF VISIT: Valerie is a mother of 5 very active children. She is constantly running her children to various activities. Often she has to leave the children at one activety while running to another. In the spring when baseball and soccer
            games sometimes get "rained out", she is left wondering right up till the time of the game if her child will play or not. She is looking for help in getting advanced notice on weather related incidents in her area that could affect her scheduling.
        </p>
        <p>DEVICES USED: Valerie will mainly check the site on her phone.</p>
