                    <p> BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Idaho Gov. Brad Little on Wednesday announced stricter guidelines for social interactions to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. </p>
                    <p> The Republican governor said the state was adopting federal guidelines that include avoiding social gatherings of more than 10 people. The guidelines also call for not eating or drinking in bars, restaurants and food courts, but to
                        use drive-thru or pickup options. Little also recommended avoiding discretionary travel and shopping. </p>
                    <p> The goal, he said, is to slow the spread so that healthcare facilities aren't overwhelmed and to protect the elderly and people with health conditions, who are more susceptible. </p>
                    <p> "First and foremost, I have to keep everybody healthy to the extent that I can," Little said at a news conference. "So I need to minimize the risks now."</p>
                    <p> Little declared an emergency on Friday because of the coronavirus, when there were no cases in the state. Health officials say nine people have now tested positive and that two are hospitalized.</p>
                    <p> State epidemiologist Christine Hahn said they didn't know if any of the nine cases involved community spread, a serious escalation in that it would mean someone hadn't traveled out of their community and didn't know how they came in
                        contact with the virus. <a href="https://idahonews.com/news/coronavirus/idaho-coronavirus-covid-19-latest-wednesday-brad-little" target="_blank">For full Article</a></p>
