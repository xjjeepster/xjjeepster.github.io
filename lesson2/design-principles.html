            <p>KSL along with most news sites do a great job of displaying hierarchy. They have their main news story in a large format at the top of the screen. They have the heading and font larger then the other story's that follow. KSL will have a couple
                of lesser stories in a medium format below their main story. Following their medium format they will then have a list of other news articles in a small format.

            <h3>PARC Contrast</h3>
            <h4>RAZER Inc. </h4>
            <a href="https://www.razer.com/">www.razer.com</a>
            <img src="images/www.razer.com_(iPhone 5_SE).png" id="razer" alt="screenshot of razer website">
            <p>Razer's website has a lot of great contrast. Their header is a subdued grey with thier menu icon in white. Thier logo is a bright green that stands out and calls notice to their branding. This bright green is seen throughout the rest of the
                page used as an accent in images, titles, and icons. They have a dark background with subdued text. When they want to call attention to a specific title or image, they will use lighter text and images that pop out of the dark coloring.

        <div class="item">
            <h3>White Space</h3>
            <h4>GOVX </h4>
            <a href="https://www.govx.com/">www.govx.com</a>
            <img src="images/www.govx.com_(iPhone 5_SE).png" id="govx" alt="screenshot of GOVX website">
            <p>GOVX is a vendor for military and law enforcement equipment. They utilize white space to give space between their products and elements. This causes a very clean look even when in a mobile application. It is easy to read, follow, and navigate
                within the site due to the available whitespace included in the padding and space between elements.
